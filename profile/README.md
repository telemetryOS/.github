# What is TelemetryOS

TelemetryOS is a platform for deploying content and applications to displays at
scale. Anything from digital signage, interactive kiosks, control systems, and
more.

A TelemetryOS device can be attached to any display supporting HDMI, and touch
input can be added via USB. That device can then be paired to a TelemetryOS
account via our Studio interface - a web application providing device management
and creative tools to create and assign content to your devices.
